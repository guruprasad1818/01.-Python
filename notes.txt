      -> Directly executing code on python Interpretort  using

    -> Syntax - rule and guidlines

    -> 9 is literal number , it doesn't need to be defined before hand 
    -> hello world is a text, which needs to be represented in wsingle or

        words and sentences
    
    -> Python has same concept, which are called as Keywords

        -> keywords + syntax = program / app

    -> import is a keyword --> imports module --> module is a .py file
