-> write Python code

   -> script mode (100%)
     
     -> using code editor
      
   -> Command line / Interactive mode(Quick checks)

      -> Directly executing code on python Interpretort  using 
          CLI (Command line interface)

    -> Syntax - rule and guidlines

    -> print (hello world) -- issue 
    -> print (9)

    -> 9 is literal number , it doesn't need to be defined before hand 
    -> hello world is a text, which needs to be represented in wsingle or
     double quotes

       -> print (hello world) wrong syntex 
       -> print ("hello world") correct syntex  
    
    -> Like English has 26 alphabets, which is basis for forming 
        words and sentences
    
    -> Python has same concept, which are called as Keywords

        -> keywords + syntax = program / app

    -> import is a keyword --> imports module --> module is a .py file

  -> Identifiers
       
       -> Within python an Identifier is name used to identify following

          -> Variables 
          -> functuions
          -> Classes
          -> Objects
          -> methods
          -> modules 
          -> etc 
           
        -> rules for naming Identifiers

            -> can contain 

               -> letters (a-zm, A-Z)
               -> sdigits (0-9)
               -> underscore(_)

               
            -> String : A sequence of characters declared between '' or " "
            -> NOTE : Python doesn't support single character data type
        
        -> Boolean Type:

            -> Returns True or False 
        
        -> Sequence Types 

            -> String is also a sequence type
            -> List : Multiple Values to be stored as a sequence, represented in [] -> Mutable (Changeable)
            -> Tuple : Multiple Values to be stored as a sequence, represented in () -> Immutable (Not Changeable)
        
        -> Set Type

            -> Set : Multiple Values to be stored as a sequence, represented in {} -> Unique Data Only
            -> Frozen Set : Multiple Values to be stored as a sequence, represented in {} -> Unique Data Only & Immutable

        -> Dictionary(Mapping) Type

            -> Dictionary : Multiple Values to be stored as a sequence of key and value pairs, , represented in {}

        -> None Type : Represents nothing i.e absence of value

        -> NOTE : All the above are predefined data types, we can create our custom data types based on requirements
